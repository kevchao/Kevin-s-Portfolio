    <p>
        As of right now, I don't have any concrete ideas for projects I want to work on. Like many others, I do kind of want to 
        work on some kind of game. I've wanted to create a game since I was younger, but never managed to figure out what game to make.
        Most of my interests revolve around video games and computers, so a lot of the things I want to work on would fall into those categories.
        Some other stuff I want to do would be learning Photoshop, since I have some experience editing photos already. Playing around with VR
        would also be cool because I haven't experienced it at all.
